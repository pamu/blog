title: Programming with arrows
author: Nagarjuna Pamu

Arrows is very interesting concept in functional Programming. Arrows are used
in FRP (functional reactive Programming) a lot. Though Arrows are less powerful than Monads,
being less powerful than Monads has great benefits.

One such benefit is that all the params of arrows are explicitly passed instead wiring params
implicitly inside an environment in case of Monads.
